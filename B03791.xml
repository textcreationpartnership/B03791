            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>INFORMATION</hi> For the Miniſters in the Dioceſs of <hi>Aberdene</hi> Cited before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to moſt of the Kingdom, that the Miniſters of the Dioceſs of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> gave full and ſufficient Evidence of their firm Adherence to the Proteſtant Religion, and that in the moſt dangerous times. After it pleaſed God to bring about this Revolution, and to Eſtabliſh His Majeſty upon the Throne, they did ſubmit unto, and own His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Government, and ſent ſeveral Addreſſes humbly ſupplicating for Protection, and had repeated Aſſurances thereof given them under His Majeſties Hand, thorow the benign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences whereof, they lived in their Charges peaceably and Chriſtianly ſetting about the Office of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>It having pleaſed the Honourable Members of this current Parliament, to aboliſh Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, thereafter to Eſtabliſh Presbeterian Government, and having lodged the power in the perſons of the then ſurviving Presbeterian Miniſters, and ſuch as they had admitted, or ſhould admit; there was a Meeting of a General Aſſembly indicted, which accordingly met, but there being none admitted, or preſent to repreſent the <hi>Nother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Diocces,</hi> the ſaid Miniſters did humbly Addreſs themſelves to His Majeſtie, who thereupon at the next General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recomended to the Members thereof, to admit of their Brethren who conformed to Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, in the Terms of a <hi>formula,</hi> which His Majeſtie was graciouſly pleaſed to concert for them.</p>
            <p>Conform, and in Obedience to His Majeſties Letter, the Miniſters foreſaid ſent their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the General Aſſembly, who in the terms of the ſaid <hi>Formula,</hi> offered to unite with their Presbeterian Brethren, that ſo any further Diviſions in this Church might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and the Whole Miniſtry of the Nation might be duely repreſented in a General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but this their Addreſs being rejected, they returned <hi>re infecta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereafter the General Aſſembly having appointed Committees, to go thorow the <hi>North,</hi> for Planting Vacancies, and doing ſome other things for which they had given them particular Inſtructions, and accordingly theſe Committees having cited ſome of the Epiſcopal Miniſters before them, they with ſome others of their Brethren did meet, and having drawn up ſome four or five Queries, relating to their Ecleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, to be preſented unto the ſaid Committee, where to they deſired Reſolution 'er they could be clear to ſubmit themſelves unto them; to which when they got no Satisfactorie Anſwer, the Miniſters foreſaid did with all Submiſſion to the Civil Government, enter their Proteſtation and appealed to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie for Protection.</p>
            <p>The Committee judging that thereby their power is incroached upon, did Addreſs His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties high Commisſioner and Eſtates of Parliament, for redresſing Grievances: and thoſe that more immediatly concern theſe Proteſters are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Primo,</hi> That they meet in their pretended Presbyteries and Synods, and Act as if they were Legal Judicatories. 2. That diverſe of them have intruded into vacant Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any legal Call, Allowance of, or Application to any Church Judicatory for that Effect. 3 That the Committee when in the North, met with ſeveral Proteſtations from the Epiſcopal Miniſters, which were Declinatures of the Authority of the Church Judicatures, tending to perpetuat Schiſm, and a manifeſt contempt of the Law.</p>
            <p>This Addreſs being read in Parliament, it was recommended to the Honourable Committee appointed for Security of the Nation, to conſider it, and to call before them the Miniſters concerned in theſe Proteſtations: and accordingly they being Cited and Compearing, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Praeſes</hi> and other Members of that Honourable Meeting, to Ordain them to give in Anſwers to thir ſeveral Points underwritten, <hi>viz. Primo,</hi> By what Authority they kept Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 2. How they came to preſent the Queries to the late Committee of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And 3. How they vindicat their Proteſtation from claſhing with the Civil Power. In the Terms of which Ordinance, they having the next day Compeared, gave in their following Anſwers, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:175262:2"/>
            <p>As to the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> By what Authority they keep Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They declared, they did not keep any authoritative Meetings, as Church Judicatories, but only for Conſultation and Deliberation, how to demain themſelves in their ſeveral Charges, for ſuppreſſing Sin and Vice, and advancing the Intereſts of the Goſpel: And they being under no Cenſure from any Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtick, they thought they might continue in ſuch Meetings from time to time, being all along under His, Majeſties Protection. As to the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> How they came to preſent the Queries to the Committee of the late <hi>General Aſſembly?</hi> Its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they were encouraged thereunto by the eight Article of Inſtructions, given by the <hi>Aſsembly,</hi> to the Committee foreſaid, wherein its ſeriouſly recommended to them, and they peremptorly required to take all pains to Inform, Convince and Satisfie all ſuch perſons of their Miſtakes, who think that they had receeded from their known Principles, and having had no previous Opportunity of Conference, for removing their Scrouples, they humbly conceived that they were obliged to lay hold upon that Occaſion. And had there been any Chriſtian and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Conference afterward allowed them, it is like, before this time their Debaits and Doubts might have been buried, and theſe things removed out of the way, which are the Occaſion of their ſad and woful Diviſions.</p>
            <p>As to the Third, that their Proteſtation doth claſh with the Civil Power, It was Anſwered, That as hitherto they have owned his Majeſties Authority, by praying for his Majeſty, keeping the Faſts and Thankſgivings appointed by the Government, and are reſolved to continue in ſo doing. So it was never their Deſign or Intention to do any thing which might ſeem to contradict their conſtant Profeſſion and Practice, neither will they own or adhere to any thing which may appear to be inconſiſtent therewith: And finally, had they ever thought that this their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal and Proteſtation, would have given any offence to the Civil Power, they would never have entered or preſented the ſame.</p>
            <p>By all which it may appear, that as hitherto they have indeavoured to live unblemable in their Lives and Doctrine, ſo they have been ſo far from deſigning to do any thing that might be offenſive to the Civil Government, that they have hitherto intirely depended upon his Majeſties gracious Favour and Protection; and therefore they in all humility expect, that his Majeſties high Commiſſioner, and honourable Eſtates of Parliament will be convinced of this their ſincere Vindication, and allow them the ſame Protection they have had from His Majeſty, they behaving themſelves as good Chriſtians and Loyal Subjects in their ſeveral Stations.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="addendum">
            <p>
               <hi>That his Grace His Majeſties High Commiſſioner, and Honourable Eſtates of Parliament may be the more convinced, that the preſenting of theſe Querries was out of no Deſigned Contempt, but that theſe Miniſters were Incouraged ſo to do by the Inſtructions from the Aſſembley to their Committee, there is here ſubjoyned the Eight Paragraph thereof, as it is contained in the 11</hi> Act <hi>of their Aſſembly, Intituled</hi> Act <hi>approving Overturs anent a Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly, and Inſtructions thereto, the words wherof are.</hi> And it being Informed, that ſeveral aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are laid on the Miniſters and Judicators of the Church, by ſome Perſons, as if the ſaids Ministers and Judicators, and receded from the known Principals thereof, in Relation to the Conſtitution and Government of the Church, contained in the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> though the contrair thereof be Evident, not onlj by the Miniſters, their owning of, and Adhering to the ſaid <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> wherein theſe Principals are contained, but alſo by the whole Courſe of their Miniſtrie: That therefore, the General Aſſembly require the ſaid Commiſſion, to take all due Pains, to Inform, Convince, and Satisfie any ſuch Perſons of their Mistaks, that they may be Reclaimed</p>
